How to setup and run the project!

First, pull the repo from `https://github.com/1997justin12/s30-reacthjs.git` to your directory.
After pulling the project, go to the location where you download it and open your commandline run `npm install`.
By doing so it will install all the necessary and required dependencies/library used by the project.
After it finish downloading the depndencies, go back to your commandline again and enter `npm run start` and it will automatically run the program.

Thank you!!!
